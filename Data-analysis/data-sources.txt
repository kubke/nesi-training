Highlighted in yellow the data that is used for calculations.
**** TOTAL FTE for CRIs from Review of CRI core funding - MBIE 
**** USE this total FTE as total number for SCION as cannot find a total number there
**** USE Staff FTE as staff number when needed
*** I think it may be better to just relate to CRI wrt total staff from MBIE ????

NeSi usage data
Table from Kidd @ NeSI - 
Create nesi-mfk-test-data with tab with all information
Create columns for years based on start/end date - where no end date use only start date
use id to identify unique users
use project id to identify unique projects
Remove all project whose codes start with ceres or rvmf which are CeR projects
Retain NeSI classification of discipline (project_reporting_discipline column)
retain project test99999
add institution type column
Remove identifying information where affiliation is in NZ, use NZ affiliation institution. Otherwise, put as other
