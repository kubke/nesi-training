# Estimating the number of researchers per institution, per discipline

Uses data for 2016 R&D survey (from stats.nz), data from 2012 PBRF, and CRI reporting documents to estimate the size of the workforce. Higher education institutions are tagged as heduni (for universities, under PBRF definition) or hedother, for non-university tertiary institutions that contribute to PBRF. 

## R&D survey 2016

Provides size of research workforce in Government, private business and higher education for years 2014 and 2016 as number of researchers and ftes (resarcher, student researcher, technician and support staff). Sources: 
Research and Development survey 2016, file rd-2016-tables.xlx, Table 7, downloaded from (http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/businesses/research_and_development/info-releases.aspx)
*Totals presented in the table are different from actual sum of numbers in the table. 

## PBRF data

Uses PBRF reporting data for higher education that provides the total number of funded Evidence Portfolios per institution (Table A-1) and per discipline (Table A-2). 
Source: PBRF-2012-Supplement-Appendix-A-Part-1, (http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/funding-and-performance/funding/fund-finder/performance-based-research-fund/previous-quality-evaluation-rounds/)


## CRI data

Uses CRI data obtained from annual reports to estimate the research workforce in each CRI. The data is very inhomogneous - (data collected in CRI Staff data.xlsx, and numbers 'chosen' from there)

## NeSI Learners

by year and by institution
2017, 2016, 2015, 2013 from _"learners_by_organisation.csv"_ provided by Aleksandra.

## Files/Sources:

_rd-2016.csv_ : 
Data reorganized from: rd-2016-tables.xlsx, tab 7 

_"researchers-hed.csv"_: 
all higher education institutions and their respective number of funded eps (by institution). Source: PBRF-2012
number of NeSI 'learners' by institution for the years  2013, 2015-2017.

_"researchers-discipline.csv"_: 
all funded eps by the different top level PBRF research disciplines. Source: PBRF-2012
Number of NeSI users by discipline: data from NeSI Annual Report 2016, p.16. Data were combined to meet PBRF discipline definitions. 

_"researchers-cris.csv"_ 
 Researcher workforce in CRIs from individual CRI annual reports or other documents. Total number of staff for CRIs is populated from the CRI Core Funding Review May 2016 (MBIE)
 Includes nesi learners provided by Aleksandra.
 Includes line 'other' to reflect that there are NeSI learners that cannot be categorized under tertiary nor CRI

* heduni:universities
* hedother:other higher education
* cri: crown research institute
* otherinst:other institutions (inc. govt and business)




funded.eps: 
Number of funded evidence portfolios in PBRF 2012 round. 
* Institution: PBRF 2012 Supplement Appendix A Part 1 Table A-1
* Discipline: PBRF 2012 Supplement Appendix A Part 1 Table A-2

res.staff.number: 
for heduni and hedother:
Calculate percentage of Eps - (toal = 6311.41) -> includes all institutions

estimate HED research number from total population:
Tot number researcher 2016: 10700 (from file rd-2016-tables.xlx, Table 7 stats.nz)’

CRI numbers
From annual reports, etc - all data in CRI staff data.xlsx
Sources therein
Highlighted in yellow the data that is used for calculations.
**** TOTAL FTE for CRIs from Review of CRI core funding - MBIE 
**** USE this total FTE as total number for SCION as cannot find a total number there
**** USE Staff FTE as staff number when needed
*** I think it may be better to just relate to CRI wrt total staff from MBIE ????


student numbers and EPS
Data from: https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/tertiary-education/participation
Provider-based-EFTS-field-of-study-course-level.xlsx

Provider-based-enrolments-predominant-field-of-study.xlsx
Provider-based-Equivalent-Full-Time-EFTS-2008-2015-final.xlsx
Added MS and PhD students only - reorganised fields of study as per 2018 PBRF guidelines.
****  Excludes students from Mixed Field Programmes: Total: 15, EFT: 0
**** There is no student number in Maori Knowledge and Development
Calculate values in table saved in student-numbers.xlsx
**** Total number (institution) = 25850; total number (discipline) 27865
**** Total number of student researchers (as per R&D 2016) = 16400

Data Input, etc:

* Set up tables in Excel as CSV - make sure all tables are as “number”
* Open Refine -> change cells to number, save projects and files

rd-2016 -> RD survey 2016 data
researchers-cris -> CRI data
ressearcher-discipline -> HED data per discipline (per PBRF 2012)
researcher-institution -> all HED as per PBRF 2012

NeSi usage data
Table from Kidd @ NeSI - 
Create nesi-mfk-test-data with tab with all information
Create columns for years based on start/end date - where no end date use only start date
use id to identify unique users
use project id to identify unique projects
Remove all project whose codes start with ceres or rvmf which are CeR projects
Retain NeSI classification of discipline (project_reporting_discipline column)
retain project test99999
add institution type column
Remove identifying information where affiliation is in NZ, use NZ affiliation institution. Otherwise, put as other
